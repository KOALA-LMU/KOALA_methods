% This is a template to be used for the preparation of
% papers submitted to the 33rd International Workshop on
% Statistical Modelling, to be held in Groningen, Netherlands,
% July 15-20, 2018.

% Please follow the following general guidelines:
%
% (1) Do not specify any definitions, commands or style parameters.
%     Upon submission, your file will be checked for presence of
%     \newcommand or \def statements and if found, error message will be reported
%     by the submission form.
%
% (2) Follow the template below very tightly.
%
% (3) Include .pdf figures using the \includegraphics
%      command, an example of which are given below.
%
% (4) Use file names which begin with the surname of the first author.
%
% (5) When creating labels for cross-references, please start always
%     by surname of the first author, e.g., \label{smith:likelihood}
%
% (6) The template below contains some example materials
%      to guide you through the preparation of your paper.  However,
%      remove all the redundant material from your final document
%      before submitting.

% The guidelines above are needed in order to be able to combine all
% the papers into a single proceedings book of acceptable quality.
% Please follow the guidelines as strictly as possible. Deviations may
% result in papers being either refused by the registration form
% or sent back to the authors with the request to change
% their documents according to the guidelines.

% Special characters:
% Please do not use special characters (e.g., accents).
% Use TeX composition instead, such as \~n, \'a, \`e, \v{s}, \r{u} etc.

% Changes as of IWSM 2013:
%  * \usepackage{booktabs} added which allows \toprule et al. in the tabular environment
%    (\hline\hline is not longer used)
%  * '^\T' added in iwsm.sty to denote transposed vectors and matrices within math (see example below)
%  * \usepackage{amsmath, amssymb} introduced since IWSM 2012 is allowed (allowing usage of boldsymbols
%    and other handy constructions (align, pmatrix etc.) within math)
%  * \usepackage{psfrag} introduced since IWSM 2012 is NOT allowed

% Title and running title to be used as left header:
\title{Coalition analyses with KOALA}
\titlerunning{Short title used as left header}

% Authors and running list of authors to be used as right header:
\author{Alexander Bauer\inst{1}, Andreas Bender\inst{1}, Andr\'e Klima\inst{1}, Helmut K\"{u}chenhoff\inst{1}}
\authorrunning{Bauer et al.}    %% use \authorrunning{Surname 1} if only 1 author
                                    %% use \authorrunning{Surname 1 and Surname2} if two authors
                                    %% use \authorrunning{Surname 1 et al.} if more than two authors

% Institutes of all authors
% Include city and country of each institute, do not include the full address.
\institute{Department of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\"{a}t, Munich, Germany}

% E-mail of presenting author for correspondence
\email{Alexander.Bauer@stat.uni-muenchen.de}

% Brief abstract of the paper:
\abstract{Abstract text}

% Keywords (at most 5):
\keywords{Keyword1; Keyword2; Keyword3.}

% Produce the title:
\maketitle

%***********************************************************************

% Sections and subsections (do not use lower levels):

\section{Section 1}
Text for the first section. This section will have two subsections.

The hat matrix is defined as
$$
H=X(X^\T X)^{-1}X^\T
$$
Please note we use \verb|^\T| to mean transposed matrices and vectors.

\subsection{Section 1.1}
Text for the first subsection within section 1. (Do you really need subsections ?)
\subsection{Section 1.2}
Text for the second subsection within section 1.
\section{Section 2}
Text for the second section. This section will have no subsections.



%***********************************************************************

% Tables can be included at any place in the text.
% As general format, use tables with horizontal lines only
% (i.e., no vertical lines separating columns).
% Start and end each table with a double horizontal line.
% Tables are incorporated using a table environment:

\begin{table}[!ht]\centering
% A caption is put above the table and a label is defined
% to be used for reference to this specific table.
% Use labels which are very unlikely to be used by
% other contributors; for example, use labels starting
% with the surname of the first author.
\caption{\label{smith:tab1} Caption text \textbf{ABOVE} the table.}
% A table with three columns, where the first is left aligned,
% the second has centred entries, and the third is right aligned,
% is generated as follows (note: if requested, use \cmidrule{} instead of \cline{})
\medskip
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
% First line:
\toprule[0.09 em]
% The body of the table:
Title col1 & Title col2 & Title col3 \\
\midrule
row1 col1  & row1 col2  & row1 col3  \\
row2 col1  & row2 col2  & row2 col3  \\ %
row3 col1  & row3 col2  & row3 col3  \\
% last line:
\bottomrule[0.09 em]
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% In the text, reference to the Table can be made as follows:
We refer to Table~\ref{smith:tab1} for a summary of our main results. Have a look to Table~\ref{smith:tab2} for
an additional example.

\begin{table}[!ht]\centering
\caption{\label{smith:tab2} Caption text \textbf{ABOVE} the table.}
\medskip
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
% First line:
\toprule[0.09 em]
% The body of the table:
  &\multicolumn{2}{c}{Title  for cols 2 -3} \\
\cmidrule{2-3} %
Title1 & Title2 & Title3 \\
\midrule
& $a$  & $c$ \\
& $b$  & $d$ \\ %
\midrule[0 em]
Total  & $a+b$  & $n$  \\
% last line:
\bottomrule[0.09 em]
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



%***********************************************************************

% Figures can be included at any place in the text.
% The only allowed formats for figures are pdf files.
%
% Please, do not include figures in any other format.
%
% Use file names which are very unlikely to be used by
% other contributors; for example, use file names starting
% with the surname of the first author.
% Figures are incorporated using a figure environment:
% Make sure you specify the extension of the file (pdf)

Finally a figure (in \verb|.pdf|!)

\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
% You can pre-specify the width of the graph:
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/exFig.pdf}
% Below the figure, a caption is put, and a label is defined
% to be used for reference to this specific figure.
% Use labels which are very unlikely to be used by
% other contributors; for example, use labels starting
% with the surname of the first author.
\caption{\label{smith:fig1} Two previous organisers looking relieved.  NOTE: Caption text \textbf{BELOW} the figure.}
\end{figure}


% In the text, reference to the Figure can be made as follows:
We refer to Figure~\ref{smith:fig1} for a~graphical representation.
